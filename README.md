## Overview

**SolarPoweredPiano** is a customizable and programmable piano keyboard built using using an ESP32. It's an easy project for new coders to learn programming. The programmable macropad has a a 24 programmable capacitive touch sensor.

## 3D Model

You can view and interact with the 3D model of the PCB [here](https://www.flux.ai/yeettheanson/solarpoweredpiano?editor=pcb_3d).


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
- SolarPoweredPiano PCB

### Installation

### Install the Required Libraries:

Open the Arduino IDE and go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...**. In the Library Manager, search for the following libraries:

- **Adafruit_MPR121.h**


### Using the Keyboard and Mouse Libraries

The **Adafruit_MPR121.h** library is for the ESP32 to communicate with the touch sensor processing IC
